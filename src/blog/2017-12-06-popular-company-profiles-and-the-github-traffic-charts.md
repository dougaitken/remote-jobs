I'm always interested to see if and how the remote-jobs repository is popular. I've looked on GitHub at the Insights > Traffic tab quite a few times, and tweeted previously about it.

I wanted to know exactly what "views" and "unique visitors" meant when there is only a 14 day window shown.

2.5K views, wut?!

"Is that in the 2 week period, surely not... * counts individual days * ...oh " and "I wonder if those uniques are a tally?"

So I asked GitHub support, and sure enough, those numbers are _only_ for the period shown. Yes, if someone comes back like every 3 weeks, they are shown as a unique for each count, but still, this is humbling to me.

Those top four are consistent. The reddit ones are a bunch of threads which change over time but the way traffic is counted, it is per domain. The fastcompany link is a cool [blog post about remote work](http://fastcompany.com/3068312/the-digital-nomads-guide-to-working-from-anywhere-on-e) - *"The Digital Nomadâ€™s Guide To Working From Anywhere On Earth"* from Feb this year. The remainder change at times.

This is what I'd like to focus on at times and dig into how *useful* this site can be. 19 different people have viewed [&yet](https://andyet.com/)'s profile over the past 14 days, 11 for [10up](https://10up.com/), and the same for [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com). I mean, &yet might get a bump since they are the first company listed so it could be people checking out the format for the profiles.

The search term is odd, that hyperlink is just `https://github.com/remoteintech/remote-jobs/search`, last time I checked it had someone's name!

 

Does you hire remote employees / contractors? [Send me some details](https://github.com/remoteintech/remote-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener)!
