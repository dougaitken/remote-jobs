Drew, part of the Support Driven community has a great post about what was like to constantly [search for a job for a year](https://supportdriven.com/2018/01/05/best-tips-for-your-job-search/).

I know the feeling, I did similarly before I landed my current role.

I hope that this, and the Remote In Tech list can help in some small way.
