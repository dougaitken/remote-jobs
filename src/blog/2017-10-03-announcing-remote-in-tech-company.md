This is your very first post.

For some reason, I like keeping the first post. It's nice to know where you began. Like where the idea for this site originated.

<p class="lead">On 13th October 2015, Jessica posted this ^ She then started to compile these on the [remote-jobs](https://twitter.com/jessicard/status/653787364767039488) repository. I saw the tweet and started [committing](https://github.com/remoteintech/remote-jobs/commits?after=7e7c045d81159797e85f1aba4bff48fdd970fc49+139&author=dougaitken) the next day.

<p class="lead">After a while, Jessica asked if I wanted to become a maintainer... the rest is history.

Part of this process is what lead me to my role at Automattic, we're more than remote - we're distributed, and like more than a few companies on this list, we don't have a main office. And I want to support more people to find a role that fits them in a company who support working remotely/distributed.

As part of #hacktoberfest 2017, I'm looking to move the list online, probably using JSON, and allowing people to properly search the list.
