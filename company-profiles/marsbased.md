# MarsBased

## Company blurb


MarsBased is a development consultancy from Barcelona offering end‑to‑end web & mobile apps based on Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and Python. We work for Fortune 500 and high-growth companies from all over the world with our distributed team of senior software engineers and designers.

## Company size

At present, we're 19 full-time employees plus 6 contractors/freelancers (20/12/2023).

## Remote status

We're a 100% remote-first company. We do not have physical offices, and at present, our employees are scattered around Spain and Portugal.

We have tried async for two years and while it hasn't worked 100%, we still do a fair amount of our processes in this way. We tend to minimise meetings and videocalls to a minimum but we depend on each client. In the company, though, we don't do dailies.

Every three months, we host the Martian Day, during which we all team up in Barcelona for a couple of days of get-together, hands-on meetings with the founders, workshops, keynotes and some time off. Once per year, we go on a company retreat for a few days of work and leisure.

## Region

We're just hiring EU-residents with a working permit. Freelancers willing to do contract work might apply from anywhere, but won't be eligible for a full-time job inside the company.

## Company technologies

Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js, Angular, React, Vue.js, React Native, Python, Django, FastAPI, Flask, CSS.

## Office locations

No physical offices, but we're from Barcelona.
