# 17hats

## Company blurb
At 17hats, we wake up each day with one goal in mind â€“ to help small business owners achieve success.

Statistics show that one out of five small businesses fails within the first year. Why? Because most business owners lack the proper business foundation. They burn out before they succeed. It is our job as a company, and as a team, to lower that statistic.

Are you an energetic team player with a passion for small business? If so, we would love you to join 17hats!

## Company size

11-50 employees (as of october 2022)

## Remote status
