# LogDog

## Company blurb

LogDog is a remote debugging/logging SDK (iOS and Android) with a web ui. Captures all logs, requests and events in real-time and allows to intercept them.


Debugging and Logging are crucial skills in every developers life. Current tools don't cover all use cases and make it especially hard for none-developer to dig deeper into their apps.
LogDog bridges this gap by offering a debugging experience unified across iOS and Android and brings the freedom to operate wirelessy with real-time logs.
It also simplifies communication in a remote scenario with 1-click sharing of debugging session.
HTTP Request interception and mocking complete the package and give you full insights on whats going into and out of your apps.
